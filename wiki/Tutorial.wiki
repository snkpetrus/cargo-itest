When using maven2 you can simply start by adding the following dependency to your POM file:
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>nl.tranquilizedquality</groupId>
	<artifactId>cargo-itest</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

After that you need to do the following things:
#  Extend from [http://cargo-itest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/nl/tranquilizedquality/itest/cargo/AbstractTomcatContainerUtil.java AbstractTomcatContainerUtil] class. Check the sample [http://cargo-itest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/test/java/nl/tranquilizedquality/itest/cargo/AppTomcatContainerUtil.java here].
